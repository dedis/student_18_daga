create node app / or reuse existing node app maybe even better to demonstrate practical scenario (e.g. wikijs)
create connector + web client + serve it (or inject it using greasemonkey or create a web extension etc..)
create docker image for node app (RP)
create OP/IdP using dex + connector
create patch for dex (or not, use my fork url, think of the best way to build the thing in docker)
create docker image for OP
docker compose + setup full system
use https
