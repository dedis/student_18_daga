create node app / or reuse existing node app maybe even better to demonstrate practical scenario (e.g. wikijs)
create connector + web client + serve it (or inject it using greasemonkey or create a web extension etc..)
create docker image for node app (RP) , that on-demand setup context and users etc..that serve a website, 
create OP/IdP using dex + connector
create patch for dex (or not, use my fork url, think of the best way to build the thing in docker)
create docker image for OP
create docker image for dagacothority, that fetch latest dagacothority package, install cmds setup/run cothority
docker compose + setup full system
use https
create web folder and specify it in config
