//	Package dagaauth provides a Onet-protocol implementing the "DAGA Server's protocol" described in
//  Syta - Identity Management Through Privacy Preserving Aut Chapter 4.3.6
//
//  The protocol is meant to be launched upon reception of an Auth request by the DAGA service using the
//  `newDAGAServerProtocol`-method of the service (that will take care of doing things right.)
